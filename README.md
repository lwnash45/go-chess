# GoChess
Go Chess is a web application that allows users to play a game of chess against a human opponent with real-time text chat.

## What
Our system will allow a player to find and play a game of chess against another human opponent. The platform is similar to Chess.com but focused on adding to an open source Golang library. Users will be able to create accounts and track their wins through our system. Furthermore, users will be able to play games of chess with their friends as well as strangers. We will also implement a messaging system which will also allow users to chat with one another during a match.

## Why
Our main task is to build a platform that utilizes a pre-existing chess library (https://github.com/notnil/chess) to facilitate creating and playing a game of chess through a REST API. Our target audience is current chess players and anyone interested in learning how to play chess.

## User Stories

| Priority | User | Description | Implementation | Service |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| P0 | As a new user | I want to be able to sign up for a new account | Upon receiving a POST request to /v1/users, the gateway creates a new user account and stores it in the user database. | API gateway |
| P0 | As a returning user | I want to be able to sign in and out of my account | **Sign in:** Upon receiving a POST request to /v1/sessions, the gateway verifies the user credentials and provides a bearer token for calls that require authentication. **Sign out:** Upon receiving a DELETE request to /v1/sessions/mine, the gateway ends the session for the currently authenticated user. | API gateway |
| P0 | As an authenticated user | I want to be able to request a game with a stranger | Upon receiving a POST request to /v1/games the user who requested the game will be sent to the matchmaking service. This service will match the user against another random user. | Chess + matchmaking microservices |
| P0 | As an authenticated user in a game | I want to be able to see what the board currently looks like (where all the pieces are located) | Upon receiving a GET request to /v1/games/{id}, an SVG of the current game state is sent. | Chess microservice |
| P0 | As an authenticated user in a game | I want to be able to move my piece from one place to another | Upon receiving a PATCH request to /v1/games/{id} the move is validated by checking if it is the turn of the user sending the request. The move is also validated using chess logic. **Valid move:** The updated information in the database is returned and an SVG sent to a message queue and delivered via websocket by the API server to the players. **Invalid move:** plain text message stating why the move is invalid. | Chess microservice (+ API gateway for websocket handling) |
| P0 | As an authenticated user in a game | I want to know when I have won or lost a game | Upon receiving a PATCH request to /v1/games/{id} that either is checkmate or surrender, a message is sent to to the message queue specifying the winner of the lobby and broadcast to the players. The lobby and all messages are also deleted. | Chess + messaging microservices (+ API gateway for websocket handling) |
| P1 | As an authenticated user in a game | I want to be able to surrender a game | Upon receiving a PATCH request to /v1/games/{id} that includes a surrender flag, the game is ended (see above). | Chess + messaging microservices (+ API gateway for websocket handling) |
| P1 | As an authenticated user in a game | I want to be able to send messages to the person I am playing against | Upon receiving a POST request to /v1/chat/{id}, the chat microservice will post a new message to the specific channel that is then sent to the message queue. It is parsed by the gateway, and then sent to the receiving clients through websockets. | Messaging microservice (+ API gateway for websocket handling) |
| P2 | As a user | I want to be able to track wins/losses | Upon receiving a GET request to /v1/stats/{id} the win/loss ratio of the user with that id are returned. | API gateway |
| P2 | As an authenticated user in a game | I want to be able to check for valid moves | Upon receiving a GET request to /v1/games/:gameid/moves, a list of possible moves are returned. | Chess microservice |
| P3 | As an authenticated user | I want to be able to request a game with my friend (by knowing their username) | Upon receiving a POST request to /v1/games with a user name in the body, a request to play a match is created and a message sent to the user with the matching username. | Chess microservice (+ API gateway for websocket handling) |
| P3 | As an authenticated user | I want to be able to accept/reject a targeted game request | Upon receiving a POST request to /v1/requests/{id}: **Acceptance:** a lobby is created for the sender and acceptor of the match request. The notification that the game has begun is sent to the message queue and broadcast via websocket to the appropriate clients. **Denial:** A message is sent to the message queue to be delivered to the sender of the request that the request was denied. | Chess microservice (+ API gateway for websocket handling) |
